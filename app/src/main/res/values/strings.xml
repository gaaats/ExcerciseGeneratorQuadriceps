    <string name="text_activity_good">Your quad muscles, or quadriceps femoris, are a group of muscles at the front of your thigh. Together, they contain more mass than any other muscle group in your body. You use your quads to perform a variety of movements, including kicking, running, jumping and walking. In the past, experts believed there were four quad muscles. In Latin, the root “quad” means “four or fourth.” But recently, they discovered a fifth muscle in this group. Your quads are vulnerable to injuries, such as contusions (bruising) from blows to the front of your thigh. These muscles also handle a lot of strain from your hip and knee joints, so quad strains or “pulled quads” can occur.</string>
